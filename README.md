originate-origin
================

[loom][1] origin for creating loom origins (yo dawg).

Usage
-----

Lets pretend you wrote the most stylish framework in world named
'tophat'. Now you want to create an application development
project "scaffold" for your users:

```
$ npm install -g loom
# > yo dawg, I heard you like originating origins with originate
$ originate origin originate-tophat
# > so I put an origin in your originate
$ cd originate-tophat
# > so you can originate while you origin
# add some files to loom/templates/
# add some logic to loom/generators/tophat
$ npm publish
```

That's it, now people can use it with `originate tophat my-app`.
